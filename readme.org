#+TITLE: 50 Days, 50 Projects: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to my personal repository for the "50 Days, 50 Projects" challenge based on the O'Reilly Media book series. In this repository, I will be documenting and organizing my journey of completing 50 mini-projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the span of 50 days.

* Overview

This repository is a collection of 50 self-contained projects, each designed to improve my skills in front-end web development. The projects will cover various concepts, techniques, and challenges, helping me to grow as a developer.

* Project Structure
Each project follows a consistent structure (lmao as if I'm consistent):

#+begin_src none
project-name/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
└── js/
    └── script.js
#+end_src

- `index.html`: HTML file for the project's user interface.
- `css/styles.css`: CSS file for styling the project.
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript file for interactivity and functionality.
  
Additionally, the `images/` directory may contain project-specific images or assets.
